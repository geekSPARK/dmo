# OSC Inventory
This document is an inventory of all the OSC tricks we are attempting to do for the Digital Motion Showcase. It covers the possible, the imagined, and the implemented.
## Parameterized art
These are the things that might be influnced by the right OSC source.

### SPARKcritters
Justis Peters is building a virtual ecosystem called SPARKcritters. It will be projected on the wall or possibly on the floor. Here are some of the things he may be able to modify based on OSC data:

+ increase the presence of certain nutrients the critters consume
+ move a critter to a specific location
+ import a simple sprite and treat it as a critter
+ visually highlight a specfic area of the ecosystem

## OSC data sources
These are things that artists have offered to send over OSC. If you are interested in consuming one of these source, please coordinate with the artist early.
